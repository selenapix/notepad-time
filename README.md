Deployed link : https://notepad-time.onrender.com

## Usage
Once the user selects "Get Started", they will be directed to a new page, in which they have the option to type a new note. They just need to provide a note title and text. After that portion is filled out, they can select the "Save Note" button in the top right corner, and the note will appear on the left side of the screen, with the red trash can button that provides the option to delete the note. There is also a "Clear Form" button in the top right that will clear the note that is being taken.
